# data-analytics-framework [All code must be considered experimental and under development]

The Data Analytics Framework is designed to simplify the process and toolset by which data analytics can be designed and implemented.

## How to use
All functionality for use of the framework are in DataAnalytics.py .

Sample code and an introductory guide are provided in hello.ipynb .

## Design
The framework follows a simple process of:

Data Import -> Data Modelling -> Data Analysis -> Data Export

All features are based on the use of Pandas Dataframes and as such would be compatiable with other python code which utilises the Pandas Dataframe.

All features in early development will aim to follow the outlined process. A complete feature map can be found below.
